# pytorch-deep-learning

This repository provides resources for learning deep learning with PyTorch, including tutorials, code examples, and exercises.


### Code Structure

The codebase is organized into folders, each focusing on a specific deep learning topic (e.g., convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks). 

Within each topic folder, you'll find:

  * **tutorials:** Step-by-step explanations with code walkthroughs. 
  * **code:** Python scripts implementing the concepts covered in the tutorials. 
  * **exercises:** Coding challenges to test your understanding.

### Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python (version 3.6 or later) and PyTorch installed on your system. Refer to the official PyTorch documentation for installation instructions: [PyTorch install](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
